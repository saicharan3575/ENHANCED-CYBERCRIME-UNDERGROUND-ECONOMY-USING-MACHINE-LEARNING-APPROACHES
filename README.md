# ENHANCED-CYBERCRIME-UNDERGROUND-ECONOMY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACHES

The practical problems faced by cybercriminals motivate our study. We take a data analytics approach and investigate the cybercrime economy from a design science perspective. To achieve this goal.
we (1) propose a data analysis framework for analyzing the cybercrime underground to guide researchers and practitioners.
(2) define CaaS and crimeware to better reflect their features from both academic research and business practice perspectives.
(3) use this to build a classification model for CaaS and crimeware.
(4) build an application to demonstrate how the proposed framework and classification model could be implemented in practice.

As a Final Year Project , Me and My Team Developed a Machine Learning Approach on Cybercrime using Naive Bayes Classification Model
